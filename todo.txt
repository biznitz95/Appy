Look into:
    1)  MVC pattern: Model View Controller. Put the properties in the model and
        have the model interact with functions. Might also be helpful to lookup
        LCOM4 (Cohesion Theory)

    2)  Final declaration: tells the compiler that this won't be subclassed and helps
        because it doesn't need to look further when methods are called.
        ex: final class RegisterViewController: UIViewController {


    4)  Force casting
        private var skyBlueColor: CGColor { return UIColor.flatSkyBlue()!.cgColor }

    8) Look into AutoLayout Stack Views

To do:

    1) Lock user interaction when they tap on a tableviewcell

    2) Add progressHUD When tap on tableviewcell or adding anything

    3) Create checkInPermission for already existing request or already existing user including main user

    4) Method for deleting entire category or group and not having other users crash
