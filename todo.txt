Look into:
    1)  MVC pattern: Model View Controller. Put the properties in the model and
        have the model interact with functions. Might also be helpful to lookup
        LCOM4 (Cohesion Theory)

    2)  Final declaration: tells the compiler that this won't be subclassed and helps
        because it doesn't need to look further when methods are called.
        ex: final class RegisterViewController: UIViewController {

    3)  What is @discardableResult

    4)  Force casting
        private var skyBlueColor: CGColor { return UIColor.flatSkyBlue()!.cgColor }

    5) Doing things like extension UIView to avoid function calling seperately

    6) What is convenience init

    7) Transform the dismisskeyboard() to work like shake() in View+ShakeAnimation.swift

    8) Look into AutoLayout Stack Views
