Look into:
    1)  MVC pattern: Model View Controller. Put the properties in the model and
        have the model interact with functions. Might also be helpful to lookup
        LCOM4 (Cohesion Theory)

    2)  Final declaration: tells the compiler that this won't be subclassed and helps
        because it doesn't need to look further when methods are called.
        ex: final class RegisterViewController: UIViewController {


    4)  Force casting
        private var skyBlueColor: CGColor { return UIColor.flatSkyBlue()!.cgColor }

    8) Look into AutoLayout Stack Views
